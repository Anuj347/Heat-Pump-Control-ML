#Optimizing Heat Pump Operation using Decision Tree Algorithm

Project Overview
This repository contains the code developed for optimizing the operation of a group of heat pumps covering the thermal demand of a building. The optimization is achieved using a Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm built with the scikit-learn library in Python. The primary objective is to determine the most efficient way to operate multiple heat pumps in cascade mode, based on external factors affecting their performance.

Key Features
Heat Pump Models: Analyze various heat pump models to understand external factors like outdoor temperature, output temperature, and partial load, which impact the coefficient of performance (COP).
Decision Tree Algorithm: Develop a Decision Tree algorithm to optimize the cascade operation of heat pumps.
Programmable Output: Generate a decision-making model using Python functions/packages that produce if/else statements for practical implementation.


Workflow
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Analyze and preprocess the heat pump operational data, focusing on the factors that affect the COP.
Model Development: Build a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn to optimize heat pump performance based on operational data.
